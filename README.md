Chapters brief

1. Why we should use React?
  We cannot directly set a value as an variable in html in JavaScript. To do so we need to use getElementById or something like that and need to set innerHTML/innerText with some value which will increase the code a lot. So, React came up with an idea where data can be set in HTML directly by placing a variable.

2. Features of React
  1. We can split our code into multiple components and reuse them wherever needed, which is known as modularity.
  2. React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI which is better than updating content in actual DOM Manipulation. And only the changed code in virtual DOM gets re-rendered in actual DOM others won't change.
  3. Debugging and maintenance of code is easy in react
